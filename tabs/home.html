			<h1>Hi, I'm Iain.</h1>
			<p>I am a Graduate Software Engineer working on embedded IPTV
                solutions at Exterity, as well as enthusiastic open-source software programmer
                in my spare time too. I Graduated in 2018 with a First Class
                Honours degree in Computing Science from the University of
                Dundee, presenting an honours project that incorporated
                software engineering, UX design, machine learning and image
                processing principles to create an integrated software package
                for assisting in clinical diagnosis of brain tumour mutations.</p>
